# Password Generator

# Description

The purpose of this project was to create an application that generates a random password for the user.  The user clicks a button that reveals a prompt window that will walk you through the steps to create the password.  The prompts will list the criteria needed such as upper and lower case letters, special characters or numbers.  Password length is also specified.  A random password generator is a great way to help people use strong passwords for high level security on their information.  

## Usage

The user can click the red generate password button to follow the window prompts that will create a random password.
